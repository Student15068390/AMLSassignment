# Assignment Overview

### Intro
Welcome to the Applied Machine Learning Systems Assignment!

During the last couple of years, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have acquired major attention due to breakthroughs in a variety of fields such as voice recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision. Thanks to statistical methods, the capabilities behind these networks are impressive; without any prior knowledge about large amounts of data, they can estimate patterns and formulate underlying functions.

We have been presented with a dataset of 5000 labeled images which was specifically designed for this challenge. It consists of pre-processed subsets from the following datasets: CelebFaces Attributes Dataset – face images of celebrities; and Cartoon Set dataset– face images of cartoons. Moreover, we must note that some noisy images have been added to the dataset, more specifically images of natural backgrounds, which are expected to be removed before processing our data.

The aim of this repository is to demonstrate how to successfully clean our dataset and correctly classify the images contained within it. 

### Repository composition

The repository is composed of the following folders:
- Binary Tasks: 
Containing the codes of all attempts to solve the binary classification challenge

**FinalModels_Inception_CleanData** is the most important one. It contains the codes which allowed us to solve our problem and create the required CSV files.

**SVM_Implementation** contains the codes of the SVM Implementations to the binary tasks. These are considered as a benchmark to the other models. 

**WithNoise_InceptionModel** contains the same codes as the FinalModels file above, however these were processed with Noise included in the dataset.

- CSV_Results:
Where to find all the csv files requested.

- Multiclass_Task:
Contains the code of the multiclass classification task for Hair_Color recognition.

- Noise_Cleaner:
 Contains the code for the noise cleaning step of the assignment. 

- Supplementary_Work
Contains codes of practice work carried prior to tackling the challenge, as well as other attempts to solve the challenge by using different classifiers such as the Haar or LBP classifiers.
